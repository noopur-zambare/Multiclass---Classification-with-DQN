# Incorporating Deep Q - Network with Multiclass Classification Algorithms
* Attempted testing the way supervised machine learning techniques and deep q networks perform together
* Investigated whether deep reinforcement learning techniques could assist multiclass classification to increase prediction accuracy
* Worked with varoius base models including Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes.

### Results and Analysis
#### Comparitive Analysis for baseline algorithms with DQN 
| Model | Accuracy | Recall   | Precision |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Decision Tree  | 0.98 | 0.50 | 0.50 |
| With DQN  | 0.33 | 0.28 | 0.34 |
| Random Forest   | 0.99 | 0.50 | 0.50  |
| With DQN   | 0.32 | 0.29 | 0.34  |
| Naive Bayes  | 0.99 | 0.75 | 0.67  |
| With DQN   | 0.31 | 0.28 | 0.34  |
